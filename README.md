## Description  
This code is basically my implementation of [Django's **Start** project](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/2.0/intro/tutorial01/). I'll keep pushing as I work on it.  

## License  
Do whatever you want with it.  
*It's technically not mine anyway.*  

```python
while self.is_alive() and self.is_running():
  self.learn(new_stuff)
```
